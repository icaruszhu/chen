### Double-manual harpsichord by Robert Falkener, London, 1773
This instrument bears the inscription ‘Jacobus Kirkman Londini Fecit’ on its nameboard.  However, Kirkman was in the habit of spelling his name ‘Kirckman’ on the front of his instruments.  Inside, we find some explanation in the pencilled inscription ‘Robert Falkener London Fecit 1773 September’.  In 1771, Kirkman brought an action against Falkener for ‘exposing to sale a certain Harpsichord for a large sum of money to wit the Sum of £27.6s. as and for a harpsichord made by the said Jacob’.  Since this court case precedes the instrument in date by some two years, it is not clear whether the two parties came to some agreement, or Falkener simple continued to apply other people’s names to his products in order to be able to charge higher prices.  In any case, this is a fine example of a late eighteenth-century harpsichord with a five-octave compass (F1,G1 to f3), two sets of 8ft strings, one set of 4ft strings, a lute stop, buff and machine stop.  It was almost certainly owned by General John Reid (1721–1807), who founded the Reid Chair of Music at the University of Edinburgh, and who bequeathed his instruments to the University with effect from 1839.
