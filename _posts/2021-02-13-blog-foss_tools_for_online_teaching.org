I am new to remote online teaching. Also, as a digital (and analogue) introvert, I feel nervous and apprehensive when talking in front of any camera to a pile of hardward.   

In the near-apocalyptic era of Covid-19, I think I need to overcome my fear and embrace the brave new world of online teaching.

As I will need record quite a few lectures and lead interactive seminars,  I spent the whole summer watching various tutorials and testing my computers. Here are the three tools I have been using most.


i) OBS: for recording lectures

ii) DroidCam: for turning an old mobile phone into a visualiser

iii)  Emacs org-mode: as an interactive seminar note book
