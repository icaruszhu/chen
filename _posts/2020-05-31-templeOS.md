Is Terry Davis's TempleOS the software equivalent of Beethoven's Symphony No.5?

[Davis (1969â€“2018)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_A._Davis) is a solitary programmer who writes this public-domain operating system called [TempleOS](https://templeos.org/). I happen to notice that Davis was born in the same year as Linus Torvalds.
