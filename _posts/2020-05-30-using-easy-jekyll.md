I have tried to integrate Jekyll blogging into my Emacs workflow.

I am so glad to find the ``easy-jekyll`` package, which can be installed from Melpa. One can install it with the good old ```use-package```

Once installed, the eponymous ```easy-jekyll``` command is bound to ```C-c C-e```. It is truly EASY to use!
