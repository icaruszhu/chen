<p>Is Terry Davis’s TempleOS the software equivalent of Beethoven’s Symphony No.5?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_A._Davis">Davis (1969–2018)</a> is a solitary programmer who authors this public-domain operating system called <a href="https://templeos.org/">TempleOS</a> written in the programming language called HolyC.</p>

<p>I also happen to notice that Davis was born in the same year as Linus Torvalds.</p>
