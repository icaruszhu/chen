<p>I have tried numerous Linux distros (including Fedora, OpenSuse, MX Linux, ElementaryOS, Ubunutu (with Gnome and Mate), Mint, Manjaro, KDE Neon, Puppy Linux, TinyCore, etc etc) in the past. So I think I am a qualified “Linux distro hopper”. I have not tried FreeBSD, simply because BSD is seriously NOT a Linux distribution ;-)</p>

<p>The current GNU/Linux system I settle on is Kubuntu 20.04 (a Ubunutu distribution with the K Desktop Environment). I like the KDE Plasma experience a lot. Almost one month ago (April 2020), I tried to upgrade from Ubuntu 18.04 to Ubuntu 20.04, but failed spectacularly. This failure made me look around for something else and I chanced upon Manjaro KDE (which is an ARCH based distribution). I used Manjaro KDE for about a month and I liked it a lot. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pacman</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Yay</code> made it super easy to install bleeding-edge software packages from <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">AUR or ARCH User Repository</a>. For example, it is a bit a pain to install the latest version of <code class="highlighter-rouge">pandoc</code> from the official Ubuntu software repo. With <code class="highlighter-rouge">pacman</code>, all I need to do is to type a one-line command <code class="highlighter-rouge">pacman -S pandoc</code> in the terminal.</p>

<p>However, Manjaro KDE, for some unknown reason, was not able to power on the two external moniters connected to my laptop. (I suffer from screen fatigue after spending long hours working in front of my laptop. That’s why I need extra screens to make my eyes feel a bit more comfortable) This became a major reason why I needed another distro and I eventually ended up, thankfully, with the current Kubuntu.</p>

<p>I wish, and I only wish, I will not “hop” around in the next five or even ten years (but who knows!). There has been both euphoria and frustration in distro hopping, indeed!</p>
