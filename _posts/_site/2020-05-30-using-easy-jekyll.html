<p>I have tried to integrate Jekyll blogging into my Emacs workflow.</p>

<p>I am so glad to find the <code class="highlighter-rouge">easy-jekyll</code> package, which can be installed from Melpa. One can install it with the good old <code class="highlighter-rouge">use-package</code></p>

<p>Once installed, the eponymous <code class="highlighter-rouge">easy-jekyll</code> command is bound to <code class="highlighter-rouge">C-c C-e</code>. It is truly EASY to use!</p>
