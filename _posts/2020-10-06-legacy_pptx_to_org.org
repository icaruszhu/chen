As I no longer use MS powerpoint for making presentation slides, I need to convert all my old pptx files into the ~org~ format. ~Pandoc~, at the moment, does seem to, support ~pptx~ as an input format, so I have to find a workaround. Here is a 3-step solution that seem to work well

- a) use LibreOffice Impress to open an pptx files

- b) Export pptx file to [[https://filedn.com/lvjEGnSit1pQw941XB4wFTk/blog-image/ppt2org/pptx2-single-html.png][as a single html (screenshot)]]

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html

<img src="https://filedn.com/lvjEGnSit1pQw941XB4wFTk/blog-image/ppt2org/pptx2-single-html.png" width="50%"> 

#+END_EXPORT

- c) Pandoc

~pandoc legacy.html -o emacs-org.org~

That's it!
