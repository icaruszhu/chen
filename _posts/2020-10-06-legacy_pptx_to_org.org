As I no longer use MS powerpoint for making presentation slides, I need to convert all my old pptx files into the ~org~ format. ~Pandoc~, at the moment, does not seem to, support ~pptx~ as an input format, so I have to find a workaround. Here is a 3-step solution that seem to work well.

- Step (i) Use LibreOffice Impress to open an pptx files

- Step (ii) Export pptx file to as a single html file (and name it as ~legacy.html~)
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 300
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100
#+ATTR_LATEX: :placement [h] :width 50%

- Step (iii)  Pandoc

Finally, ~pandoc legacy.html -o emacs-org.org~

That's it!
