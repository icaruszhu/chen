I feel ashamed to call this an emac package. It is small hack that extends ~esay-jekyll~ for writing blogpost in org-mode. 

The vinilla ~easy-jekyll~ only allows you to write your post in markdown.  

I write ~easy-jekyll-org-newpost~ to allow me to start an org file. This function depends on the =jekyll-org= plugin. 


 an un-package, which I write 

I do not want to clutter my init.el further as there is quite some code. I decide to put all the relevent code into one single which can be shared and re-used with the rest of the world. 



  


This is my first emacs un-package.  after using emacs for over a year.
