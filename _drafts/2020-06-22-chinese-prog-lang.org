This is one of my favourite talks from youtube. Does that mean classical Chinese is also Turing complete?

No surprise that this project called  =Wenyan= (文言文編程語言) [[https://github.com/wenyan-lang/wenyan][A programming language for the ancient Chinese]] has gathered 16k stars on Github. A ~for~ loop that prints  =Hello World= for three times would look like this:


#+BEGIN_QUOTE
吾有一數。曰三。名之曰「甲」。
為是「甲」遍。
        吾有一言。曰「「問天地好在。」」。書之。
云云。

Also, Chinese characters (that are composed of radicals)  also seem to be conducive to the idea of modal editing. Maybe all Chinese scholars should use Vim or Emacs evil-mode for Chinese text editing ;-)
