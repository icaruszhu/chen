The Alembic theme does not display the author's name in a post by default. So some modification is needed.

As I want have the author's name with an underscore in the credit line.I add the following code to display in the credit line 
~post-meta.html~ in the ~_include/~ directory. 

#+BEGIN_SRC html
 {%if page.author %} 
 <u> {{page.author | prepend: "An un-thought by &nbsp;&middot;"}} </u>   
 {% endif %}
#+END_SRC

Just in case you wonder what does  ={%if page.author%}= and ={% endif %}= do in the above code. It is actually an ~if~ statement written in =liquid= template language (or so-called "short code" in the context of Jekyll). If a post does not specify the =author= in the =yaml= front matter, the above line of code will not be executed and nothing will be displayed.
