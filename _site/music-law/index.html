<p><strong>Professor John Cairns</strong>, (Edinburgh Law School) Welcome</p>

<p><strong>Session I (chaired by Dr. Smita Kheria, Edinburgh Law School)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Chen Wei Zhu (IASH, UoE)</strong>, Lord Mansfield unwrapped: the significance of Bach v Longman in the history of music copyright</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On 10 June 1777, Lord Mansfield, Chief Justice of King’s Bench, handed down an important ruling in Bach v Longman, which established statutory copyright in music under the 1709/10 Statute of Anne. Less than a week later, on Monday 16 June 1777, the rest of the King’s Bench ratified Mansfield’s decision. (By pure coincidence, this research workshop takes place on the same day and same date of the week 237 years later.) The plaintiff, Johann Christian Bach (1735-1782), also known as the “London” Bach, was Johann Sebastian Bach’s youngest surviving son. He went to London in 1762 and became one of the most prominent composers in Georgian England in the second half of the 18th century, though he never managed to achieve what Handel had achieved before him in the first half of the century. Winning this particular case seems to have been a one-off courtroom success for J.C. Bach, who failed to develop a fully-fledged Classical style in music. The task of forging and perfecting the Classical style was later fulfilled by, amongst others, his student Mozart. Charles Sanford Terry, in a biography written in the 1920s, laments that J.C. Bach “has slumbered in a neglected grave” compared with his other brothers’ (especially C.P.E. Bach) musical achievements. My paper explores the much overlooked music aesthetics of Lord Mansfield, and how it is reflected in this landmark music copyright ruling in relation to J.C. Bach’s music.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Jenny Nex</strong> (Musical Instrument Collections, picture of their music publishing and musical UoE), Longman, Lukey &amp; Broderip: The (il)legal  instrument making business</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The activities of the firm led by James Longman with his two partners Charles Lukey and Francis Fane Broderip were central to musical life in London for over thirty years, from the late 1760s to the early part of the nineteenth century, while their wider legacy can still be seen today.  Their work encompassed all areas of musical life, from instrument making and dealing to music publishing, selling concert tickets and entertaining visiting musicians.  They were also involved in numerous court cases relating to property rights of both printed music and musical instruments.  These cases demonstrate the central issues facing the music trade at the end of the eighteenth century.  The definition of and the ownership of the work itself was central, but issues relating to reversionary copyright, the publication of extracts, and acquiring and republishing music from abroad were also important.  This paper uses Longman &amp; Brodeirp as an example to explore issues of intellectual property in the late eighteenth century and the ways in which these litigations established the complex copyright laws we enjoy today.</p>

<p><strong>Session II  (Chaired by Dr Chen Wei Zhu)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Tom Tolley</strong> (Edinburgh College of Art, UoE) ‘A bloody harmonious war’: Haydn, Pleyel, and Copyright in Late Eighteenth-Century London</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘A bloody harmonious war’ is Haydn’s punning description of the rivalry between the concert organization for which he worked in 1792, headed by the violinist Salomon, and the ‘Professional Concert’, whose star attraction at this time was Haydn’s former pupil, the composer Pleyel. Haydn’s choice of language, mixing musical and combative metaphors, reflects how newspapers projected this rivalry. While Salomon, for example, was regularly titled ‘Generalissimo ’, Pleyel was linked to William Braddyl, England’s leading advocate for pugilism. Even a legal setting for the imagined conflict was envisaged: ‘The NOTES of Haydn and Pleyel are likely to produce some discords in the Courts.’</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Haydn and Pleyel really did find themselves in court in London, called as deponents in a lawsuit between two of their publishers. Although interpretation of this case has hitherto focussed on Haydn’s supposed misappropriation of compositions by Pleyel, evidence indicates that it was actually instigated to determine ownership of copyright, a matter of considerable significance to both composers contemplating the publication arrangements of their London commissions.  Instrumental compositions by both men had previously been extensively published (and pirated) throughout Europe; but their respective compositions written specifically for the rival London concert organizations had distinct fortunes. Whereas Haydn’s London symphonies were soon widely disseminated through numerous publications and arrangements, the equivalent compositions by Pleyel, though fêted at first performance, were never published in their original form and essentially disappeared from view. The paper examines the copyright issues behind these contrasting fates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Dr. Lance Whitehead</strong> (independent scholar),  Robert Falkener: an eighteenth-century harpsichord builder, music publisher and malfeasant?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our knowledge of the harpsichord maker Robert Falkener (fl 1760–80) rests largely upon the existence of two counterfeit harpsichords, and a lawsuit brought against him by Jacob Kirkman for forging six harpsichords. In addition to examining the possible reasons for applying a false inscription to a harpsichord at this time, this paper will also examine Falkener’s activities as a music publisher and his appearance in various court cases, with a view to determining whether his reputation as a rogue trader is deserved or in need of some re-evaluation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/visit/museums-galleries/st-cecilias">St. Cecilia’s Hall</a> is the oldest purpose-built concert hall in Scotland and it also houses a rich collection of historical music instruments. The concert features the “original fake” double-manual harpsichord by Robert Falkener, London, 1773 (as shown in the above picture. See also the instrument note below)</p>

<p><em>First Part</em></p>

	(subject of court cases – Haydn/Pleyel. Forster v L&amp;B)</p>

<p><strong>Care donne che bramate	by Stephen Storace (1762–96)</strong>
	Sung by Madam Mara, subject of rights arguments with L&amp;B</p>

<p><strong>Sonata in G major	Johann Christian Bach (1735–82)</strong>
	“A New Lesson for the Harpsichord or Pianoforte”

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Note on the keyboard used for this concert</em>: Double-manual harpsichord by Robert Falkener, London, 1773
This instrument bears the inscription ‘Jacobus Kirkman Londini Fecit’ on its nameboard.  However, Kirkman was in the habit of spelling his name ‘Kirckman’ on the front of his instruments.  Inside, we find some explanation in the pencilled inscription ‘Robert Falkener London Fecit 1773 September’.  In 1771, Kirkman brought an action against Falkener for ‘exposing to sale a certain Harpsichord for a large sum of money to wit the Sum of £27.6s. as and for a harpsichord made by the said Jacob’.  Since this court case precedes the instrument in date by some two years, it is not clear whether the two parties came to some agreement, or Falkener simple continued to apply other people’s names to his products in order to be able to charge higher prices.  In any case, this is a fine example of a late eighteenth-century harpsichord with a five-octave compass (F1,G1 to f3), two sets of 8ft strings, one set of 4ft strings, a lute stop, buff and machine stop.  It was almost certainly owned by General John Reid (1721–1807), who founded the Reid Chair of Music at the University of Edinburgh, and who bequeathed his instruments to the University with effect from 1839.</p>

<p><em>Second Part</em></p>

<p><em>*Set Sail for the Sun from Aus den Sieben Tagen (1968)  by Karlheinz Stockhausen (1928–2007)</em>                               <br />
	performed by ‘Grey Area’</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is one of “15 text compositions for intuitive music in variable settings” written in 1968 during a period of personal crisis. Most of the pieces were performed by the Cologne/Stockhausen Ensemble as part of their repertoire until the 1970 World’s Fair in Osaka and have been performed by many other groups since. In Osaka, the ensemble played Stockhausen’s music every day for 6 months, and in this concentrated atmosphere, the tensions inherent in the different creative practices required by these pieces strongly contributed to the demise of the group. During the World’s Fair a letter was sent to Stockhausen by some members of the ensemble in which they essentially claimed ownership of the music, citing the fact that they were playing and creating their own music whilst nominally performing Stockhausen’s works. In recent interviews with surviving members of the ensemble, it has been suggested that some parts or even entire pieces in this collection were essentially transcriptions made by Stockhausen of practices or techniques that the ensemble members themselves had developed.</p>
